<h1>Roast Vegetables</h1>
<p>This easy recipe takes 10 minutes to prepare and another 40 minutes of cooking time.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>6 potatoes - peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>1 chopped butternut pumpkin</li>
    <li>1 red onion - diced</li>
    <li>Sea Salt</li>
    <li>Black Pepper</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Optional: Crushed or minced garlic</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Method</h2>
  ol>
    <li>Pre-heat oven to 200C. Line a baking tray with baking paper (or you can use these silicone tray liners which you just wash and re-use).</li>
    <li>Peel potatoes and chop them into cubes. Chop the pumpkin into cubes - you can leave the skin on or off. Peel and chop the onion into 1/8 pieces.</li>
    <li>Place ingredients in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over them. Put salt and pepper over. Toss the ingredients. If, like me, you like garlic, you can add some crushed or minced garlic but completely up to you.</li>
    <li>Line the tray with the vegatables. Try to spread them evenly apart - this will help with the cooking. It also helps to get them onion evenly spread out so the potato and pumpkin absorb the flavour.</li>
    <li>Place in the oven. After 20 minutes, turn the vegetables. Cook for another 20-30 minutes. Cooking time will depend on your oven and how thickly you cut the vegetables.</li>
  </ol>
